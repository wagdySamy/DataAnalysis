## Dataset

>The Ford GoBike System dataset contains information about individual rides made in a bike-sharing system covering the greater San Francisco Bay area. There are arounf 183412 records in the datset with main attributes that describe rides such as start station, end station and duration.

## Summary of Findings


> The average trip duration that the users took was around 10 minutes. The trips were mostly in February and most trips were taken by males. 90% of the total trips were taken by Subscribers. Also, the age group with the most trips was between 30-35 years old.
> The Customers users  usually took more time in their rides than Subscribers.
> All gender types with age range of 30-35 took the longest trip duration in average and surprisingly, in the male and female categories, age range of 50-60 took the second longest trip duration.

## Key Insights for Presentation

> For the presentation, I display the influence of variables on the trip duration. 
> Afterwards, I introduce each of the relationship one by one. The first chart shows the distribution of trip duration. Then, I do pie chart to show percentage of member gender. Note that i'm only looking at the trip duration of less than 60 minutes here, Also i added a bar chart to shows the percentage of user types, als there is one chart to illustrate the relation between the trip duration over user type and member gender.
